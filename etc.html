    <p> Hi... it's Gia speaking now. I like the 3rd person thing...<br>
    even when I'm the one writing it. As you know now from the main page on this site,<br>
    I specialize in Video Editing, but I've gathered quite a few NEW interests I may<br>
    want to explore in the future.
        I love editing already established fottage, or editing<br>
    others video footage into something great, but I would love to start making my own short<br>
    concepts and stories! Last spring, I took an animation course and that expanded my creativity<br>
    immensely!<br>
        Along with wanting to explore animation, I would now like to dive into stop motion work<br>
    which I never thought I'd do. Claymation seems like something I would enjoy, as tideous<br>
    as it is.
