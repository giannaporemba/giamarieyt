    <h1>How it began...</h1>

    <p>Hi... it's Gia speaking now... I like the 3rd person thing... even when I'm the one writing it.<br>
    To make a long story short, I have a youtube channel where I post all my content. I got a lot of<br>
    editing practice in the last 7 years by editing movies together to music for fun and for others enjoyment.<br>
    My youtube channel has now grown to an audience of 6,000 subscribers which is insane! </p>

    <h2>...What now?</h2>

    <p>As you know now from the main page on this site, I specialize in Video Editing, but I've gathered<br>
    quite a few NEW interests I may want to explore in the future!</p>
    <p>I have loved editing already established footage, or editing<br>
    others video footage they've trusted me with into something great,<br>
    and I will probably continue to do that as a job someday, however I would love<br>
    to start making my own short concepts and stories!</p>
    <p>In the spring, I took an animation course and that expanded my creativity imemensly!<br>
    Along with wanting to explore animation more, I would now like to dive into stop motion work<br>
    which I never thought I'd do. Claymation seems like something I would enjoy, as tideous as it is.</p>
